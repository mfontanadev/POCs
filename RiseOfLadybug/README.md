# App "Rise of ladybug"

Minigame used for testing the ladybug sprite in the project Wishflower. This helped my to test the class Ladybug.js in and isolated scenario. But it became so funny that I couldn't resist to make a mini game.

As always, this is the top of  the iceberg, in this project you will find a mini framework to make your own games in javascript I like to call it "my version of SPA, using canvas".

## Motivation
- Leave to the community a mini framework (javascript) for making your own games. This was inspired in @javidx9 youtube channel, he made "One Lone Console Engine", I tried to do something similar.
- See how long it will take to be finished using David Wehle schedule, in short, one or two hours per day dedicated to the project.
- As said before, test Ladybug.js class.

## Making of
This section is about details of the development process.

<b>Features map</b>

An intent to summarizes in one picture all the game features, this gives you an idea of where was all the time put.

But first, how that picture cames to life, as a merge between a patent prints and 80's LCD games reset mode.

Finally, the features map, the idea is that you can see all the features in one picture and use it to estimate the total time to acomplish.
In this case, assuming that you can solve one feature per hour, you will need more that twelve hours (minimal) in total.

Another thing you can do is make a table with each feature and organize it in order of priority. In this case I should have resigned add some of them to avoid waste a bigger time.

## Building a new version
No steps must be performed, just modify source code and have fun.

<b>Running locally:</b>

To avoid cross-reference browser constraints, when you try to open index.html just from the file system, you can use "http-server" from NPM (take a look at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), download NPM and http-server package if you donÂ´t have it).

* Step 1: in root dir type: "http-server" and then enter.
* Step 2: open a browser window and type "localhost:8080".
* PLAN B: download "Web Server for Chrome" plugin and set initial folder to "RiseOfLadybug" in your disk.

## Code explanation

I think I will make a tutorial (leitmotiv). There are multiples concepts in this app, for example: mini game  framework in javascript, SPA using one only canvas, views, pages, game loop.
