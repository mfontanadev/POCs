# App "MicroSpy"

Game developed for Jam2020 hosted by @javidx9 (detail in https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2020)
NOTE: I have to say that I don't feel proud of my code, it was programmed in a rush.

**Game description**

You are a spy that controls a micro dron (this way nobody dies). Your mission is scape from, -The Great or The Big Machine? it is both. In order to do that you must avoid some guards that looks like Daleks.
If successful then the planet will be a better place, because you stole some secrets from THE MACHINE.

## Enjoy at
